# Triage-Saurus

Read `AGENTS.md` first for repository-specific agent instructions.
To initialise a session, copy and paste this prompt:
```text
Initialise: read AGENTS.md and Agents/Instructions.md. Then scan Knowledge/ and existing Findings/ for missing context.
First, ask me to either **copy/paste the issue** to triage or **provide a path under `Intake/`** to process in bulk.
- Example bulk paths in this repo:
  - `Intake/Cloud` (your cloud findings)
  - `Intake/Code` (your code findings)
  - `Intake/Sample/Cloud` (copy from `Sample Findings/Cloud` first)
  - `Intake/Sample/Code` (copy from `Sample Findings/Code` first)
Before asking any cloud-provider questions:
- If the user provided a bulk folder path that clearly implies scope (e.g., `Intake/Cloud` or `Intake/Code`), treat that as the triage type.
- Otherwise, ask what we are triaging (Cloud / Code / Repo scan).
- If Cloud: infer provider when the folder name implies it (e.g., `Intake/Sample/Cloud` = Azure samples in this repo); otherwise ask which provider (Azure/AWS/GCP) and then ask targeted context questions (services, environments, networks, pipelines, identities).
- If Code/Repo scan: ask for the repo path (or confirm current repo), language/ecosystem, and the scanner/source (e.g., SAST, dependency, secrets), then proceed without assuming cloud.

As each kickoff question is answered, check whether it adds new context vs existing `Knowledge/`.
- If it’s new: record it in `Knowledge/` as **Confirmed** (with timestamp).
- If it’s already captured: don’t duplicate.
```
The same prompt is also saved in `SessionKickoff.md`.

## Purpose
This repository supports AI CLI tooling (e.g., Copilot CLI, Codex CLI) to run
consistent security triaging. It provides agent instructions, templates, and
workflows for analysing scanner findings, updating knowledge, producing
findings, maintaining summaries, and regenerating the risk register.

## Workflow Overview
1. Start a CLI session in the repo root and paste the prompt from
   `SessionKickoff.md`.
2. Provide a scanner issue to triage; the agent will confirm cloud provider or
   context as needed.
3. The agent creates or updates findings in `Findings/`, updates `Knowledge/`—the live repository of environment, services, and dependency facts used to fill missing context—and refreshes relevant summaries in `Summary/`.
4. After any finding changes, the agent may regenerate
   `Summary/Risk Register.xlsx` using `Skills/risk_register.py` (explain why before running).

> Note: By default, artifacts under `Findings/`, `Knowledge/`, and `Summary/`
> are **gitignored** so they remain **user-owned**. If you want to persist/share
> them via git, update `.gitignore` intentionally.

## Using Copilot CLI
1. Open a Copilot CLI session in the repository root.
2. Type `sessionkickoff` (or paste the prompt from `SessionKickoff.md`).
3. Follow the repository instructions in `AGENTS.md` and `Agents/Instructions.md`.

## Using Codex CLI
1. Open a Codex CLI session in the repository root.
2. Type `sessionkickoff` (or paste the prompt from `SessionKickoff.md`).
3. Follow the repository instructions in `AGENTS.md` and `Agents/Instructions.md`.

## Process sample findings

1. Stage samples into `Intake/`:
   - `python3 Skills/stage_sample_findings_to_intake.py --type cloud`
2. Use your chosen CLI
3. Provide the bulk path `Intake/Sample/Cloud` (or `Intake/Sample/Code`) for processing.

During bulk processing, if a finding title clearly names a cloud service (e.g., *Storage account*, *Azure SQL*, *ACR*, *Key Vault*), record that service as **Confirmed in use** in `Knowledge/<Provider>.md`.

**Tools**
- **Python:** `python3` is required to run:
  - `Skills/risk_register.py` (generate `Summary/Risk Register.xlsx`)
  - `Skills/clear_session.py` (delete per-session artifacts under `Findings/`, `Knowledge/`, `Summary/`)
- **Dependencies:** Uses only the Python standard library; no extra packages required.
  - Optional helper: `python3 Skills/generate_findings_from_titles.py --provider <azure|aws|gcp> --in-dir <input> --out-dir <output> [--update-knowledge]`
