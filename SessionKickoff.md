# 🟣 Session Kick-off

## Purpose
This note provides a simple prompt you can paste at the start of a new session so
the agent loads the repository instructions before doing any work.

## Prompt
```text
Initialise: read AGENTS.md and Agents/Instructions.md. Then scan Knowledge/ and existing Findings/ to identify missing context (services, environments, networks, pipelines, identities). Ask me targeted questions to fill the gaps before starting any triage work.
```
