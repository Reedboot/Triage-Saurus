# Agent Instructions

This file is the canonical place to store instructions for AI agents interacting with this repository.

Suggested contents:
- Purpose and scope for agents (what tasks they can perform)
- Repository-specific conventions agents should follow
- Location of important files (README.md, .github/, any language-specific manifests)
- How to run builds/tests/lints (populate once the project adds package manifests)
- CI hooks and workflow notes (if any)
- Use UK English spelling throughout documentation and messages.

When updating, prefer short, explicit directives and keep examples minimal.

File naming convention:
- Use Titlecase for filenames where the first letter is uppercase and the rest of the word is lowercase (e.g., Instructions.md, Readme.md).

Chat behavior:
- When an agent learns something new, prepend messages with a lightbulb emoji (💡) and include a one- or two-sentence explanation of the learning in chat only.
